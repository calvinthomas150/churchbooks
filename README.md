# Churchbooks

## Inspiration

This software was inspired by need from acting at Treasurer at Our Saviour Lutheran Church (https://oslc.org.uk). While searching for appropriate software for simple bookkeeping/accounting, it became apparent that existing options, other than a spreadsheet, were cost prohibitive for small churches. 

## Functionality Goals

The current goals of this software are to meet the requirements of small churches (likely < 50 members). Those larger than this, with more complex requirements are best to look elsewhere, perhaps at more standard accounting packages. 

- [x]  Transaction import via OFX
- [x]  Budget creation
- [ ]  Tracking transactions against budget
- [ ]  Notes against transactions
- [ ]  Uploading and storing receipts against transactions
- [ ]  Splitting transactions to multiple budget requirements
- [ ]  Simple reporting, e.g. Income vs Expenditure and Balance

Over time these goals may change, further items may be added and some may be removed.
